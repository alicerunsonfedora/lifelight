# Lifelight

A game about being a role model for others

> :warning: As of right now, this repo just contains some "playground" code that can render a level from a tileset in Pygame, as well as do basic player movement with keys. I'm not sure if this project will be its own game or just the base for other projects.

## Build from source

### Requirements

- Python 3.6 or greater
- Pipenv (to install dependencies)

Clone the project and run `pipenv install` to install the dependencies. Once installed, run `main.py` in the Pipenv environment to run the game.
